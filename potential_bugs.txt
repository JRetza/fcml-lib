1. CALL bug in VS.

IRA    (66ff5701 call qword ptr [rdi+0000000000000001h])
VS2008 (66ff5701 call word [rdi+1])

Manual says:
"When in 64-bit mode, the operand size for near call (and all near branches) is forced to 64-bits"

So it's probably a bug in VS.

TODO: To check how it really works using example code ad debugging.
